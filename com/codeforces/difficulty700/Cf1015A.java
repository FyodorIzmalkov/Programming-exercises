/**
 * You are given a set of n segments on the axis Ox, each segment has integer endpoints between 1 and m inclusive. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. Each segment is characterized by two integers li and ri (1≤li≤ri≤m) — coordinates of the left and of the right endpoints.
 *
 * Consider all integer points between 1 and m inclusive. Your task is to print all such points that don't belong to any segment. The point x belongs to the segment [l;r] if and only if l≤x≤r.
 *
 * Input
 * The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1≤n,m≤100) — the number of segments and the upper bound for coordinates.
 *
 * The next n lines contain two integers each li and ri (1≤li≤ri≤m) — the endpoints of the i-th segment. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. Note, it is possible that li=ri, i.e. a segment can degenerate to a point.
 *
 * Output
 * In the first line print one integer k — the number of points that don't belong to any segment.
 *
 * In the second line print exactly k integers in any order — the points that don't belong to any segment. All points you print should be distinct.
 *
 * If there are no such points at all, print a single integer 0 in the first line and either leave the second line empty or do not print it at all.
