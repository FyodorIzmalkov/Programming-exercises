/**
 * There are n students in a university. The number of students is even. The i-th student has programming skill equal to ai.
 *
 * The coach wants to form n2 teams. Each team should consist of exactly two students, and each student should belong to exactly one team. Two students can form a team only if their skills are equal (otherwise they cannot understand each other and cannot form a team).
 *
 * Students can solve problems to increase their skill. One solved problem increases the skill by one.
 *
 * The coach wants to know the minimum total number of problems students should solve to form exactly n2 teams (i.e. each pair of students should form a team). Your task is to find this number.
 *
 * Input
 * The first line of the input contains one integer n (2≤n≤100) — the number of students. It is guaranteed that n is even.
 *
 * The second line of the input contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤100), where ai is the skill of the i-th student.
 *
 * Output
 * Print one number — the minimum total number of problems students should solve to form exactly n/2 teams.
