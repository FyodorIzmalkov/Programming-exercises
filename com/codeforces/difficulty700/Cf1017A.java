/**
 * John Smith knows that his son, Thomas Smith, is among the best students in his class and even in his school. After the students of the school took the exams in English, German, Math, and History, a table of results was formed.
 *
 * There are n students, each of them has a unique id (from 1 to n). Thomas's id is 1. Every student has four scores correspond to his or her English, German, Math, and History scores. The students are given in order of increasing of their ids.
 *
 * In the table, the students will be sorted by decreasing the sum of their scores. So, a student with the largest sum will get the first place. If two or more students have the same sum, these students will be sorted by increasing their ids.
 *
 * Please help John find out the rank of his son.
 *
 * Input
 * The first line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤1000) — the number of students.
 *
 * Each of the next n lines contains four integers ai, bi, ci, and di (0≤ai,bi,ci,di≤100) — the grades of the i-th student on English, German, Math, and History. The id of the i-th student is equal to i.
 *
 * Output
 * Print the rank of Thomas Smith. Thomas's id is 1.
